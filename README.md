 Saturated Reverse Polish Notation (SRPN) Calculator in Java

# This is the solution for the following problem:
Whilst performing some maintenance on a legacy system you find that it makes use of a program called SRPN (srpn). SRPN is not documented and no one seems to know who wrote it, so your boss tells you to rewrite it in Java. SRPN is a reverse Polish notation calculator with the extra feature that all arithmetic is saturated, i.e. when it reaches the maximum value that can be stored in a variable, it stays at the maximum rather than wrapping around.
